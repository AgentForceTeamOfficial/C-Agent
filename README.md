# **C**ost-sensitive **Agent** (**C-Agent**) Framework


> üöÄ This repo implements the preliminary version of **C**ost-sensitive **Agent** framework (**C-Agent**) with results benchmarked on [C-Webshop](https://github.com/AgentForceTeamOfficial/C-WebShop).  
> üöÄ The project is a practice of LLM-powered agent framework design under the guidance of [*Cost Desiderata in LLM-Powered Agent Research*](https://agent-force.github.io/cost-desiderata-agent-research.html).


## Performance Comparison on C-Webshop

![Plot](./figs/performance-comparison.png)

üé° **Methods used for comparison**:

- [**CoT-SC**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171): Sampling diverse Chain-of-Thought reasoning paths and action candidates, and voting for the majority to enhance self consistency.
- [**ReAct**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629): On each step, the agent decides whether to take actions or reason about the query based on the current state.
- **ReACT-SC**: Instead of [Chain-of-Thought reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903), we apply sel consistency strategy to ReAct to further improve the performance.
- [**LATS**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04406): an advanced method that unifies ReAct, self-reflection, and tree search based planning. We adapt the original implementation in our scenario for comparison.
- **Ours**: the C-Agent framework, which is introduced in the below section.

## Introduction

### üåê C-Webshop

To be specific, for the environment construction part, the key contribution of C-WebShop to the LLM-powered agent research community is the concept of **cost** rooted in the agent-assisting process. In C-WebShop, cost originates from different sources. To name a few:
  - Self cost of LLM-powered agents. Money, time, space, etc.
  - Exploration cost from the environment. The environment to be interacted with can be evolving w.r.t. user interactions, where the cost of exploration is formed.
  - Alignment Cost from the human user. The agent is not always aware of the user preference, and the cost of alignment is formed.
    
Kindly refer to the online [article](https://agent-force.github.io/cost-desiderata-agent-research.html) for detailed categorization of **cost**. The live site demo can be found [here](http://49.232.144.86:5000/), as well as the environment [repo](https://github.com/AgentForceTeamOfficial/C-WebShop) for local deployment purpose.

The exploration cost and the alignment cost are already reflected by the task and the website design of C-WebShop. In this repo, we wrap the environment with cost-related runtime information (time and money) to compute the self cost of an LLM-powered agent.

### ü§ñ C-Agent Framework

The key challenge is to build an agent framework that manages to assist the decision process in a realistic environment, in consideration of different types of cost. We leverage structured profiles with free-form insights to make better decisions. 

![Profiler](./figs/Profiler.png)

üí° Here are some principles we follow:

- **Reduce alignment cost**: quickly adapting to the user's preference by retrieving trajectories with high rewards beforehand.
- **Reduce exploration cost**: directly extrapolating the key actions that lead to the success of the retrieved trajectories.
- **Reduce self cost**: extracting structured records from free-form insights, without the aid of LLMs or human annotators; retrieving the most similar profile for reference, instead of agent planning from scratch or searching in huge memory/experience space.

**Two major modules**:

- *Insight* part:

  - Get profiles from *Profiler* to better complete the current instruction
  - Recognize key actions of the current trajectory via reflection

- *Profile* part:

  - Long-term experience accumulation
  - Structured representation for instruction relations
  - Direct action extrapolation from the action list
  - Semantic similarity for profile retrieval

    *(For better efficiency, we only utilize the best matched profile as a reference in decision making)*

## What is the function of different directories?

- `./cwebshop-algo`: the core of our **C-agent** framework
  - `Insight.py`: the implementation of *Insight* part
  - `Profiler.py`: the implementation of *Profiling* part
  - `react_w_insights_w_profiler_v1benchmark.py`: the implementation of our C-Agent algorithm on C-Webshop benchmark

- `./environments`: running environment of our C-Webshop benchmark (the encapsulation of our core environment)
  - `env_instr_list_cwebshop_runtime_session.py`: the capsule of run-time environment leveraging cost information for C-Webshop benchmark

- `./baselines`: source code of baselines
  - `README.md`: the instruction of how to run baselines and implementation details

## How to replicate experiments of baselines and ours?

Prepare for the conda environment:
```sh
conda create -n cdab
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda activate cdab
```

Add your OpenAI API key to your environment:
```sh
# on Linux/Mac
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

```powershell
# on Windows
set OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

For ReAct-series and CoT-series baselines, change your working directory and run the corresponding script directly:
```sh
cd baselines
python cot_least_to_most.py
python cot_sc.py
python react.py
python react_sc.py
```
For LATS baselines:
```sh
cd baselines/lats
mkdir runtime_logs
python lats.py
```

For RAP baselines:
```sh
cd baselines/rap/rap_webshop
python rap_inference_v1benchmark.py
```

To test our method:
```sh
cd code
python react_w_insights_w_profiler_v1benchmark.py
```

After running the script, the results can be found in the directory `./runtime_logs`
